# This Readme will be updated soon.
Current version: Flowstate 3.1
Please get the Required files from Releases!

To run correctly Flowstate scripts you will need:

1. Playlist file. Replace playlists_r5_patch.txt in /r5reloaded/platform/
2. Optional - Flyers edited vpks for three maps. (KC, KCMU1, KCNIGHT) put the content in /r5reloaded/vpk. Enable them in playlist if you have the modified vpks.
